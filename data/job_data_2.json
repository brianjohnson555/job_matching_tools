        "Description": "About HightouchHightouch’s mission is to empower everyone to take action on their data. Hundreds of companies, including Autotrader, Calendly, Cars.com, Monday.com, and PetSmart, trust Hightouch to power their growth.We pioneered the Composable Customer Data Platform (CDP), which lets companies use their own data warehouse to collect, prepare, and activate customer data for marketing personalization and business operations. Our new AI Decisioning platform goes a step further, allowing marketers to set goals and guardrails that AI agents can then use to personalize 1:1 customer interactions. Traditionally, only technical teams had the skills to access and use customer data. With Hightouch, every business user can deliver personalized customer experiences, optimize performance marketing, and move faster by leveraging data and AI across their organization.Our team focuses on making a meaningful impact for our customers. We approach challenges with a first-principles mindset, move quickly and efficiently, and treat each other with compassion and kindness. We look for team members who are strong communicators, have a growth mindset, and are motivated and persistent in achieving our goals.What else? We’re based in San Francisco but have team members all over the world. Our Series C put us at a $1.2B valuation, and we are backed by leading investors such as Sapphire Ventures, Amplify Partners, ICONIQ Growth, Bain Capital Ventures, Y-Combinator, and Afore Capital.About The RoleWe’re looking to hire a machine learning engineer as we expand our data activation products to include an intelligence layer. While hundreds of companies use Hightouch today to sync data into their SaaS systems to automate and improve operations, there’s a lot of surface area we haven’t touched in helping companies figuring out which customers to message, what content to put in messages, and when to send messages. A lot of this work today is done manually through intuition and guesswork, and we believe that adding machine learning could have a step function impact for our customers. And given our access to data warehouses and databases, Hightouch is perfectly placed to make use of a company’s customer data in building a powerful intelligence layer.Some of the problems we’ll be working on include:Personalization and Product Recommendation: There are often many options for what content a company could message a user with, including which products to show from catalogues. Given this large state space, how can Hightouch help personalize messages with the most relevant content for each user?Automated Experimentation: Helping companies intelligently navigate and automate experiments across the extensive number of options for messaging customers.Predictive Audiences: Building models to predict which users are most likely to convert, churn, or take desired actions.Content Generation: Particularly with recent advances in LLMs, how can we help marketers generate text, images, and creatives that are compelling to their customers?Budget Optimization: Helping companies assess which marketing spend is driving the most incremental conversions, and where the marginal CAC is lowest.As an early machine learning engineer, you will help build comprehensive solutions to the above domains from scratch. Responsibilities will be highly varied and include working on customer research, problem definition, predictive modeling, machine learning infrastructure, and partnering with customers.We are looking for talented, intellectually curious, and motivated individuals who are interested in tackling the problems above. This is a senior role, but we focus on impact and potential for growth more than years of experience. The salary range for this position is $200,000 - $260,000 USD per year, which is location independent in accordance with our remote-first policy.Interview ProcessOur interview process focuses on evaluating fit for the most important dimensions of the role: product sense, ability to architect backend and distributed systems, and alignment with Hightouch’s values. Notably, we don’t do any programming interviews as we believe they are low signal to noise and aren’t a good evaluation mechanism.Intro Call [15-30m]: Introductory call with either a member of our recruiting team or the hiring manager to get to know each other and see if the role could be a good mutual fit.System Design Screen [45m]: Designing a data processing feature end-to-end.Machine Learning Modeling Interview [90m]: Designing a predictive model end-to-end, including data collection and preparation, model training and evaluation, and what systems would be needed to run the model in production.System Design Interview [90m]: Work with the interviewer to architect a system at a conceptual level. The problem will be at a pretty high level - and have both product and customer requirements as well as technical.Hiring Manager Interview [30m]: Chat with hiring manager about past experiences and future operating preferences to assess fit on company values and operating principles.

Our core thesis is that by enabling AI systems to autonomously refine their own architecture, learning algorithms, and data utilization, we can achieve orders of magnitude improvement over current methodologies.An AI system is built upon three fundamental layers: the infraestructure layer, encompassing both hardware and software infrastructure; the modeling layer, which defines model architectures and training methodologies; and the data layer, where data selection and supervision strategies come into play. Traditionally, each of these layers relies heavily on human intervention, demanding specialized expertise and manual tuning. Yet, self-improving ML systems will be able to optimize these elements with unparalleled precision and efficiency, surpassing the capabilities of human experts.By pioneering self-improving ML, we aim to make AI not just a powerful tool for automatically solving today’s challenges but a dynamic entity that can evolve independently to tackle the complex problems of tomorrow. This evolution goes beyond technological advancement; we believe it can drive meaningful change. Our research is contributing to more sustainable use of resources, reduce energy consumption, and ultimately enable AI to address environmental and societal challenges more effectively. Through this work, we aspire to harness AI’s potential to make the world not only smarter but also more sustainable for future generations.Fujitsu salaries are aligned to the specific geographic location in which the work is primarily performed.

Our first product (Sohu) only supports Transformers, but has an order of magnitude more throughput and lower latency than a B200. With Sohu, you can build products that are infeasible with GPUs, like real-time video generation models and extremely deep & parallel chain-of-thought reasoning agents. Etched Labs is the organization within Etched whose mission is to democratize generative AI, pushing the boundaries of what will be possible in a post-Sohu world.Key ResponsibilitiesImplement high-performance software components for the Kayak inference engine in RustTranslate core mathematical operations from transformer models into optimized operation sequences for SohuDevelop components of our model assembler and execution pipelineWork on performance optimization for the Sohu programming interface and runtimeCollaborate with hardware engineers to maximize chip utilization and minimize latencyImplement efficient batching strategies and execution plans for inference workloadsContribute to the evolution of our system architecture and programming modelDesign and implement cutting edge inference time compute scaling methodsRepresentative projectsOptimize operation sequences to maximize Sohu's computational resources for specific transformer architectures such as Stable Diffusion.Implement efficient memory management for KV cache sharing and prefix optimizationBuild infrastructure for continuous batching and batch interleaving to improve throughputCreate components for the Sohu runtime that optimize for utilization, latency, and/or throughputImplement model-specific inference-time acceleration techniques such as speculative decoding, tree search, KV cache sharing, priority scheduling, etc by interacting with the rest of the inference serving stackImplement structured decoding and novel sampling algorithms for reasoning modelsDevelop testing and benchmarking tools to measure and improve performanceYou may be a good fit if you haveStrong software engineering skills with systems programming experienceExperience with Rust programming languageFamiliarity with transformer model architectures and/or inference serving stacks (vLLM, SGLang, etc.)Strong mathematical skills, esp. in linear algebraUnderstanding of computational graphs, tensor sharding operations, and ML workloadsAbility to reason about performance bottlenecks and optimization opportunitiesExperience working cross-functionally in diverse software and hardware organizationsStrong candidates may also haveExperience with hardware accelerators, ASICs, or FPGAsDeep expertise in ML systems engineering and hardware/software co-design with demonstrated impact (contributions to open-source projects or published papers)Experience with low-level memory management and synchronization primitivesTrack record of optimizing large-scale inference systemsBenefitsFull medical, dental, and vision packages, with 100% of premium coveredHousing subsidy of $2,000/month for those living within walking distance of the officeDaily lunch and dinner in our officeRelocation support for those moving to San Jose (Santana West), CAHow We’re DifferentEtched believes in the Bitter Lesson. We think most of the progress in the AI field has come from using more FLOPs to train and run models, and the best way to get more FLOPs is to build model-specific hardware. Larger and larger training runs encourage companies to consolidate around fewer model architectures, which creates a market for single-model ASICs.We are a fully in-person team in San Jose, and greatly value engineering skills. We do not have boundaries between engineering and research, and we expect all of our technical staff to contribute to both as needed.
