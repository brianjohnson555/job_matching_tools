Members can play, pause and resume watching as much as they want, anytime, anywhere, and can change their plans at any time.Netflix is the world's leading streaming entertainment service. Our members rely on Netflix to entertain them, and we want to be the first place they go for that entertainment. With an audience of 600M+ and growing, we’re programming for more tastes, cultures and languages than any company has ever done before. It’s why we invest in a wide variety of TV shows and films, and work so hard to make them great.The reach of Netflix and the fandom we create fuels the “Netflix effect” - a virtuous cycle of great content and intense fandom that catapults our stories into the cultural conversation. Netflix influences what people around the world search for and talk about, the music they listen to, the books they read, the countries they visit, and how they dress.Our marketing efforts help to kick start the Netflix effect, and we are providing more and more ways for fans to engage with our stores: Tudum, events like Netflix Bites and Bridgerton experiences, and the launch in 2025 of the first two Netflix House locations.Netflix is a data-driven company, and we are hiring multiple data engineers to increase our data support for marketing and fandom activities around the world. The opportunity for impact in these roles is enormous: Netflix social media channels generate more than 100B impressions a year, we are expanding fandom into the real world, and we’ve barely scratched the surface of the data available to support these activities.What have you done and what do you know?You have 8+ years of experience and proficiency building data pipelines in both batch and real-time settings, to support a variety of use cases. Some of our data sources are small (e.g., sales at Netflix House), and some are enormous (e.g., social media feeds). Our stack is Spark, Flink, Hive/Iceberg, Kafka - experience with these specific technologies is helpful, but not strictly required.You are proficient in Python for scripting, automation, and data orchestration frameworks, and you can write complex SQL (any variant) for ad-hoc and recurring workflows. You strive to write elegant and maintainable code, and you're comfortable picking up new technologies.You understand how to model data efficiently for reporting and metrics, and how to organize data for scale and fast retrieval.You have experience sourcing and modeling data from application APIs.You’ve worked with common data warehouse solutions, such as Snowflake, Redshift, BigQuery, Vertica, Teradata, Greenplum, etc. What will you do?Fully own critical pipelines and data sets to support Netflix efforts around marketing and fandom. Directly collaborate with stakeholders to understand needs, model tables using data warehouse best practices, and develop data pipelines to ensure the timely delivery of high quality data.Creatively explore how to use data to continually add value to Netflix. Translate ambiguous business questions into clear data requirements, and then deliver on them.Be a bridge between data engineering and the business, enabling insights that empower our colleagues to make better and more informed decisions. Build strong partnerships with data scientists, analytics engineers, and machine Learning practitioners to enable research and insight delivery for the business. Who are you?You want to live and breathe the Netflix Culture. Our ways of working are different, and you are excited to embrace and contribute to our culture. You work quickly and independently while also collaborating effectively across functions (e.g. with marketing experts, data scientists, product managers). You thrive in a fast paced environment, and see yourself as a partner with the business with the shared goal of moving the business forward.You have a growth mindset, and expect the same from your colleagues. Not only talented, you are also curious, authentic, selfless, determined, and industrious. You generously give and receive candid feedback, to grow yourself and those around you. You have strong beliefs that are weakly held: you can deliberate and hear all sides of a discussion, and adapt to new perspectives that emerge from it. You are a sharp communicator who can break down and explain complex data problems in clear and concise language. You are comfortable getting outside of your comfort zone, to explore new tech, make your own tools, or find new creative ways to address an old problem.Our compensation structure consists solely of an annual salary; we do not have bonuses.

Insurance claims, financial statements, invoices, and health records are all stored in a structure that’s simply impractical for use in digital workflows. This isn’t an inconvenience—it’s a critical bottleneck that leads to dozens of wasted hours every week.Traditional approaches fail at reliably extracting information in complex PDFsOCR and even more sophisticated ML approaches work for simple text documents but are unreliable for anything more complex. Text from different columns are jumbled together, figures are ignored, and tables are a nightmare to get right. Overcoming this usually requires a large engineering effort dedicated to building specialized pipelines for every document type you work with.Reducto Breaks Document Layouts Into Subsections And Then Contextually Parses Each Depending On The Type Of Content.

Your work emphasizes simplicity, supportability, and ease-of-use, and you communicate clearly with other teams and engineers to get feedback on where we can improve.Multitasker and present: you like interrupts especially if this is blocking engineers.You switch between your project work and day to day developer experience challenges.Interest in learning how things work: you love to learn how the tools you use work at a fundamental level. You get excited at the idea of digging into third-party source code to understand how they work and find new ways to use them.Pragmatic and business-oriented: You care about business impact and prioritize projects accordingly. You don't just go after cool stuff—you understand the balance between craft, speed, and the bottom line. To you, technologies and programming languages are about tradeoffs.

        "Description": "About Lumafield: Lumafield was founded in 2019 to upgrade manufacturing. We are engineers with deep experience across the product development cycle, from initial ideas to shipping hardware, across industries and specializations, who became frustrated by the cost and complexity of modern manufacturing. So we decided to upgrade it. Engineers make million-dollar decisions every day, and they need tools that give them the greatest possible insight into their products. By offering unprecedented visibility into products, as well as AI-driven tools that highlight problems and generate quantitative data, Lumafield promises to revolutionize the way complex products are created, manufactured, and used across industries. We started with industrial CT scanning, which for us was the most valuable but underutilized tool in the manufacturing toolbox, enabling us to rapidly inspect essential components non-destructively.  We rebuilt the whole system, from X-ray capture, to computer vision analysis, to web-based collaboration, to the entire business model, making the most advanced manufacturing tech more accessible to every industry. Our company, like our platform, is designed for upgrades. We’re building for greater intelligence, autonomy, and speed. For deeper vision, operational excellence, and powerful insights.

From product analytics, to marketing, to support, to advertising, advanced data analysis in the warehouse, and even sales – customer data is the raw material for each function at a modern business.For highly regulated businesses in healthcare, it’s always been a challenge to harness that customer data and get it to the marketing and analytics tools that require it while following patient privacy laws….until now.Something as simple as running ads to get more users is simple for an e-commerce of software company to do. But common web analytics and advertising tools collect sensitive user identifiers and healthcare information automatically. Those same tools are not HIPAA compliant.We provide a layer of data governance to make current web analytics tools HIPAA-compliant. For analytics, our customers can continue getting the insights they need to improve the patient experience. For marketing, Freshpaint safeguards health information while helping our customers promote access to care through popular advertising platforms like Facebook, Google, and others.In short, we help healthcare marketers promote access to care _ and _ safeguard patient privacy at the same time.

        "Description": "What we doWe’re fixing one of the most broken and costly pieces of the US healthcare system: medical billing.Today, healthcare providers spend over $250B each year on administrative overhead just to get paid by insurance. Medical billing is expensive because it’s nuanced and hard - maybe ~100x harder than credit card payment processing - and because it’s traditionally done by armies of humans who track and manage complex rules and processes specific to individual insurance companies with little or no supporting software.We’re rethinking medical billing from the ground up, building software backed by best-in-class data science (and, soon, a dash of machine learning) to automate much of this complexity so healthcare providers can get paid dramatically more easily and inexpensively.We were in the Y Combinator W20 batch and have since been well funded by a world-class group of funds (8VC, First Round Capital, BoxGroup) + angel investors. We're now helping our customers treat opioid addiction, provide holistic care for women, lose weight, increase access to mental health care, and much more. This is such important and gratifying work; we can't wait for you to join our team and help support some of the most important innovation happening in healthcare today!Our valuesWe spend at least as much time with our coworkers as we do with our closest friends + family - if we intend to do the most important + challenging work of our lives, it’s important that these folks energize us, support us, inspire us, and push us to do our best work. This is what you can expect of your teammates at Candid (in no particular order): - We put our customers first - We take care of each other and ourselves - We anchor on outcomes and work relentlessly and creatively to achieve them - We collectively prioritize building a diverse and inclusive workspace - We believe humility is our greatest strength - We are candid, kind, and committed - We strive to be the most prepared person in the room - We are truth seekersWhat you’ll be doingYou’ll conceptualize, design, build, and maintain complex services/platforms/features and develop ownership over large swaths of our product + infrastructure.You’ll interact closely with our current + prospective customers, developing intuition around their biggest pain points and thinking of creative ways to address them.You’ll play a critical role in shaping our engineering + broader company culture and help make this the best place we’ve ever worked.Who you areYou have Bachelors of Science or Bachelors of Art in Computer Science, Computer Engineering, Math or other similar degree.Experience with the technologies we currently use is a plus, but by no means required: Python, PostgreSQL, Docker, Kubernetes, React, Typescript, Google Cloud Platform, Auth0, Terraform.You enjoy building high-quality software, but you also anchor on outcomes and have good intuition around which corners are worth cutting and which aren’t. You enjoy owning features end-to-end and are comfortable learning new tools or moving across the stack to do so.You have a customer-first and learner’s mindset, and value teaching others.You’re a clear and concise communicator; you enjoy the challenge of explaining complicated ideas in simple terms, both in-person and in writing.Pay TransparencyThe estimated starting annual salary range for this position is $135,000 to $230,000 USD. The listed range is a guideline from Pave data, and the actual base salary may be modified based on factors including job-related skills, experience/qualifications, interview performance, market data, etc. Total compensation for this position may also include equity, sales incentives (for sales roles), and employee benefits.

From product analytics, to marketing, to support, to advertising, advanced data analysis in the warehouse, and even sales – customer data is the raw material for each function at a modern business.For highly regulated businesses in healthcare, it’s always been a challenge to harness that customer data and get it to the marketing and analytics tools that require it while following patient privacy laws….until now.Something as simple as running ads to get more users is simple for an e-commerce of software company to do. But common web analytics and advertising tools collect sensitive user identifiers and healthcare information automatically. Those same tools are not HIPAA compliant.We provide a layer of data governance to make current web analytics tools HIPAA-compliant. For analytics, our customers can continue getting the insights they need to improve the patient experience. For marketing, Freshpaint safeguards health information while helping our customers promote access to care through popular advertising platforms like Facebook, Google, and others.In short, we help healthcare marketers promote access to care _ and _ safeguard patient privacy at the same time.

Since 2018, we’ve been transforming business identity verification, replacing slow, manual processes with seamless access to complete, up-to-date data. Our platform helps companies across industries confidently verify business identities, onboard customers faster, and reduce risk at every stage of the customer lifecycle.Middesk came out of Y Combinator, is backed by Sequoia Capital and Accel Partners, and was recently named to Forbes Fintech 50 List and cited as an industry leader in business verification by digital identity strategy firm, Liminal.About Middesk Engineering:We believe \"velocity\" is the rate at which we effect realized value for our customers, not the rate at which we ship code. And this pushes us to center our work around customers; how will this change I'm about to make help our customers get jobs done?When we’re coding, we're making hundreds of micro-decisions about user experience that add up. How can I communicate this exception to our customers in a manner that helps them understand what's happened and unblock themselves?Middesk Engineering is customer-first engineering. (check out our blog post on the topic).The Role:Engineers have the freedom to create a lot of impact for our customers. The role requires high agency and comfort with change. It requires people who believe the interesting problems in Engineering are stack-agnostic. It requires Engineers who believe that solving customer problems quickly is what matters first; building scalable systems matters when customer problems are scaling problems.We follow a hybrid work model, and for this role, there is an expectation of 2 days per week in our SF or NYC office. Candidates should be based within a commutable distance, as we believe in the value of in-person collaboration and building strong team connections while also supporting flexibility where possible.What You'll Do:Work in React, Redux, Ruby, Rails, Postgres, and potentially Scala, Python, and Go to solve problems for our customers. Dive into all layers of the stack; frontend, backend, API, data processors, etc. Jam with Product Managers, Designers, Ops, and other Engineers every day to shape the direction of our products. Share your knowledge with others in Engineering; people should get better at their craft because they work with you. Even if you’re early in your career, you have something to teach. Contribute to the psychological safety of your team. Software is built by groups of people, and good relationships matter. Help us interview and hire other Engineers. What We’re Looking For:While we agree the interesting problems in Engineering are stack-agnostic, we’d love it if you had experience with a couple of the languages in our stack (see the first point above). We’ve found that Engineers with prior stack experience usually ramp faster. You’ve worked for a high-growth, venture-backed startup before and are looking for a similar role. Or, you've founded a company and are looking to get back into it. You’ve been working as a professional Software Engineer for at least three or more years. You understand SaaS business fundamentals (e.g. annual contract value, customer acquisition cost, and annual-recurring revenue) and can demonstrate how the work you’ve done influences these metrics.

        "Description": "BackgroundAt Finley, we believe that today’s most innovative companies deserve financial infrastructure that can move as quickly as they can.Startups in finance, real estate, and transportation rely on debt capital to extend loans, purchase homes, and finance vehicle fleets. But these new-school companies rely on old-school technology to manage their debt capital.Think months of legal coordination, countless versioned Excel files passed around via email, and weeks of follow-ups—all culminating in a 200-page credit agreement that only lawyers understand, even though the future of the business depends on complying with it.The inefficiency of this process can delay—and in some cases block—access to capital when it's needed most. It’s time for the next generation of financial infrastructure builders to rise to the challenge.Finley’s software helps startups streamline the debt capital raise and management process. That way, they can spend more time focusing on their customers and less time worrying about fundraising.The RoleWe’re looking for Software Engineers to join our Engineering team. As an early employee, you’ll be responsible for designing, building, and testing an entirely new category of capital markets software from the ground up. You’ll architect and build the infrastructure that helps fintechs around the world collectively manage billions of dollars. Just as importantly, you’ll help shape the engineering culture and trajectory of a seed-stage startup.We’re looking for 0 → 1 individuals who are comfortable with autonomy early on and also excited to help build structures that will scale their own impact over time. In other words, we’re looking for candidates who want to build a lasting company just as much as they want to build industry-changing software.We believe in finding the best technology for the job, and being disciplined with only adopting the tools that actually let us move faster, build more securely, and enable a higher quality of life. We hate inefficiency and embrace debate to constantly find ways to make our lives easier and products better. Our tech stack (see below) reflects that philosophy.Your Responsibilities You will be responsible for helping architect, build, and scale the first lender-borrower relationship platform for the debt capital markets. - You will work with the team to design, product manage, and test early features for the Finley system. - You will become an expert in information security, data engineering and API design in a heavily regulated space. - You will become an expert on structured finance (no worries, we’ll fill you in!) and the ways in which technology can bring standardization to a field accustomed to legacy solutions. - You will help grow the Finley team by helping interview job candidates, mentor new engineers, and document standard operating procedures.Our tech stack Backend : NodeJS + Express, Apollo Server, Typescript - Frontend : React + Hooks, Typescript, GraphQL, Apollo Client - Database : Postgres + Knex - Infrastructure and deploys : AWS, Docker, ECS, CDK, CodePipeline - Collaboration : Github, Papertrail, and TrelloWe're looking for Builders. You have experience building web applications for 3+ years and can scope and ship products independently. - Problem-solvers. You focus on delivering outcomes and prefer to use the right tool for the job, rather than building for building’s sake. (That said, getting excited about a modern tech stack built on Node.js, React, and AWS wouldn’t hurt. See above.) - Collaborators. You like collaborating with Business, Design, and Product functions in addition to other engineers, and you believe that the best solutions can only emerge when everyone has a seat at the table. - Systems thinkers. You enjoy the complexity of designing for a range of stakeholders (think borrowers, lenders, and banks) and source systems. You get excited about designing for the long-term. - Team-builders. You look forward to helping recruit, train, and mentor a team of engineers at Finley.                         Show more                                                Show less"

        "Description": "tl;dr: we're looking for a world-class full-stack/backend engineer who loves simplifying complex systems, unifying fragmented data, and building high-scale systems. Learn more about us here (link).Why join us?Early-stage, yet de-risked: we are a rare combo of being early stage (high upside) but lower risk (2XX+ paying customers, $Xm+ recurring revenue, cash-flow positive for over a year, hockey-stick growth). You get the benefits of an early stage startup without the risk you’ll have at almost any other startup. You’ll have a ton of impact, work directly with our customers, and get to work on interesting technical challenges you won’t see at bigger companies. Although we’re early stage, we’ve eliminated key strategic risks you’ll face at other startups. Like an unproven product, lack of market validation, lack of revenue, over-reliance on VC funding, co-founder disputes. We’re all young and hungry. Our team is fully in-person, tenacious, and committed - most of us moved to SF from far away (Canada, SoCal, Texas, Virginia) specifically to build Agave from the ground up.Team is technical, diverse, young: you'll work with a formidable founding team that's experienced, intense, and ambitious. We've worked together for 10 years, first at a startup that Amazon acquired, then at Amazon, and now at Agave. You'll learn a ton while having outsized ownership. You’ll have a front-row seat to the good and bad of building a company from the ground up. We’re also technical - all but 1 of our team (our AE!) have either majored in CS, worked as full-time devs, and/or worked in technical roles at startups and larger tech companies for 5+ years before moving into business roles at Agave.Huge opportunity without direct competition: startups are incredibly hard, so you want to join one that has a unique advantage. You don’t want to spend years of your life on a company in a saturated market with tons of competition. We’re seizing an opportunity that’s massive (Construction is the world’s third-largest industry) but also overlooked by most people in startup land. Most who can solve this problem aren’t aware it exists or are too distracted by tech trends (blockchain, metaverse, LLMs, etc.) to notice. These talented folks get coaxed into building products that seem cool early on, but don’t solve durable problems or aren’t differentiated enough against their many competitors to be sustainable (e.g. lots of AI products), so they end-up not going anywhere or stagnating without a clear plan to grow profitably. As a result, we have a multi-year head start against potential competitors, increasing our odds of success significantly. We’re also backed by world-class investors (Accel, YC) and Construction insiders (Procore and Autodesk executives, founders of the largest construction tech companies like PlanGrid).RequirementsBack-end/full-stack engineer, ideally with 1-4 years experience (we're open to exceptional college grads with strong intern/co-op experience).Familiarity with cloud infrastructure (e.g. AWS).Self-motivated, high ownership, low ego; desire to work on a fast-paced, intense, fun team. Excited to be our next hire; passion for building a world-class engineering culture.Pumped to work in-person with us in SF 5 days/week.No need to have: prior experience with our tech stack or at B2B SaaS/API companyInteresting technical challenges?Unification: we’re unifying dozens-to-hundreds of fragmented systems under a single standard that we define. Our unification covers data objects, data models, authentication, account-linking UX, and features like filters and pagination. When designing any new feature, we have to do it in a scalable way. For example, when adding filters, we have to research each system we support (and plan to support) and create a generic, system-agnostic solution.On-prem: we’re connecting with many types of on-prem systems (SQL-based, DLL-based, API-based), many built 20-40 years ago. We provide tremendous value to customers allowing them to interface with these systems in a secure, fast, reliable way, as if they’re modern, cloud-based products. We need to support real-time communication and webhooks when they don’t exist (e.g., using web-sockets).Scale & speed: we’re handling millions of API requests per day, and growing daily. For our products that we power with our own API (e.g. Analytics), we need to store and retrieve large amounts of data in an efficient way, building elegant caching layers to reduce latency. We ship code daily and iterate quickly based on actual feedback from paying customers (they share tons!).Operational excellence: we’re creating a reliable API layer on top of many old systems that don’t have APIs. It’s like building a skyscraper on quicksand, enforced by SLAs. We need to innovate in expanding the depth and breadth of our integrations while simultaneously increasing our development velocity. We need to be very creative in how to continually test our code and integrations, creating scalable testing frameworks that can catch edge cases and bugs across 1k+ endpoints.Mix of back-end and front-end: we’re building front-end apps that dog-food our own APIs (e.g. Sync, Analytics). This helps us build world-class APIs because we suffer any pain present in our API. We’re building both the lego blocks and the higher-level lego models: we see what kinds of APIs our SaaS customers want, then also look at the kinds of API niceties we want for our own applications (like a caching layer, advanced filtering) and implement a combination of the two.Variety: without knowing, you might assume adding a new integration is low-ambiguity and routine. But each integration we launch is special, completely different and posing unique challenges. This requires researching that system and its nuances in great depth before building on top of it. It’s part engineering, part archeology.Tech stack?TypeScript, React, Redis, Postgres, AWS - CDK, EC2BenefitsHealthcare: we cover 90% of your healthcare costs with several plan options.401k: we match 100% of your contributions, up to 4% of annual salary.Relocation: sizable relocation bonus for folks currently located outside of the Bay Area.Gym: on-site gym with Peloton, squat rack, Tempo, Yoga setup, and more.Visa: we sponsor Visas (H1B, TN, etc.) for candidates who are a good fit!In-PersonWe've built Agave in-person since day 1, and will maintain an in-person culture in San Francisco going forward. We form tighter bonds, build a stronger culture, and move faster since we're all working from one location. Our office is just west of Twin Peaks, 1 block from a bus stop, 10min walk from a BART station, and a 5min drive off the 101 and 280. Our entire team commutes here every day. We believe building in-person is a huge strategic advantage, and we hope you’ll join us.                         Show more                                                Show less"

Insurance claims, financial statements, invoices, and health records are all stored in a structure that’s simply impractical for use in digital workflows. This isn’t an inconvenience—it’s a critical bottleneck that leads to dozens of wasted hours every week.Traditional approaches fail at reliably extracting information in complex PDFsOCR and even more sophisticated ML approaches work for simple text documents but are unreliable for anything more complex. Text from different columns are jumbled together, figures are ignored, and tables are a nightmare to get right. Overcoming this usually requires a large engineering effort dedicated to building specialized pipelines for every document type you work with.Reducto Breaks Document Layouts Into Subsections And Then Contextually Parses Each Depending On The Type Of Content. This Is Made Possible By a Combination Of Vision Models, LLMs, And a Suite Of Heuristics We Built Over Time.

        "Description": "✍🏻 About daydreamdaydream is a platform that automates programmatic SEO, end-to-end.The platform helps businesses identify search patterns, creates content at scale, and automatically improves that content.We've raised >$2M from leading investors like Basis Set Ventures, WndrCo, SOMA Capital and current and former Heads of Growth/Product Growth at companies like Notion, Airtable, Webflow and Dropbox. We're on a high-growth trajectory and we're looking for people who want to join us on the journey to building a billion-dollar company.Our team previously worked together at Flixed, a startup we bootstrapped to $2M+ in revenue almost purely on the back of programmatic SEO.🔧 The Problem we’re trying to solveHeads of Growth love programmatic SEO. It’s the secret growth playbook used by companies like Zapier, Canva, to acquire millions of visitors. The problem is, building a pSEO engine currently requires work from SEO analysts, content marketers, software engineers, data scientists and others. As a result, it’s logistically complicated and expensive. You can hire specialized agencies, but they cost $50K+ per month.🧑‍💻 How we’re solving this problemdaydream is building a SaaS platform that automates every piece of building a programmatic SEO engine. Everything from identifying search queries, to producing 90th percentile quality content at scale, all the way to automatically updating that content.🪴 Why we’re hiringDemand for daydream is growing fast as our ARR has already doubled since the inception of our company, all before launching a generally available product. This is exciting, but it also means we need to hire to build product faster and meet the demand. We’re looking for senior engineers that are excited to work with LLMs to serve one of the biggest markets in the world.👋🏻 The People and EnvironmentHere Are Three Key Elements Of Our CulturePush the paceNo sandbagging allowed! Everyone at daydream is expected to proactively identify when a particular goal can be met faster, and to push for acceleration.A real example of how this value has been applied — we initially thought we would hit a certain revenue milestone within 1 year. We realized we can do it in half the time, so we shortened our timeline to hit that goal to 5 months instead.Build something you’re proud ofSpeed of execution is important, but only if it’s in service of delivering a delightful experience to the customer. We want you to look back at what you’ve built at daydream and feel a deep sense of satisfaction.A real example of how this value has been applied — In the past, we’ve prioritized “wowing” the customer at each release of daydream, even at the earliest phases. Speed is no excuse for delivering a poor experience.Five star customer service onlyThe bar for customer service at daydream is always exceeding the customer’s expectations. It is not “meeting” the customer’s expectations.A real example of how this value has been applied — We’ve had situations where the customer is unintentionally moving slower than is possible with their SEO strategy. In these situations, we’ve proactively encouraged the customer to move faster.🤝 The people you’ll be working withThenuka (Co-Founder and CEO): Thenuka was previously the founder at CEO at Flixed, which he bootstrapped to $2M+ in revenue almost exclusively using programmatic SEO. Prior to that he was an Entrepreneur-in-Residence at Hustle Fund and Chief of Staff to the COO at Pango, a cybersecurity company with $100M+ in annual revenue.Shravan (Co-Founder & CTO): Shravan was previously an Engineering Lead at Flixed. Before that, Shravan worked as a Software Engineer at Facebook for three years, where he worked on mass-scale web scraping for Facebooks’ Jobs product, and Meta Reality Labs.Wesley (Chief of Staff): Wesley previously spearheaded growth initiatives at Hustle Fund’s Angel Squad, and before that, worked at Montage Partners.

We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.About The RoleYou want to build the cutting-edge systems that train AI models like Claude. You're excited to work at the frontier of machine learning, implementing and improving advanced techniques to create ever more capable, reliable and steerable AI. As an ML Systems Engineer on our Reinforcement Learning Engineering team, you'll be responsible for the critical algorithms and infrastructure that our researchers depend on to train models. Your work will directly enable breakthroughs in AI capabilities and safety. You'll focus obsessively on improving the performance, robustness, and usability of these systems so our research can progress as quickly as possible. You're energized by the challenge of supporting and empowering our research team in the mission to build beneficial AI systems.Our finetuning researchers train our production Claude models, and internal research models, using RLHF and other related methods. Your job will be to build, maintain, and improve the algorithms and systems that these researchers use to train models. You’ll be responsible for improving the speed, reliability, and ease-of-use of these systems.You May Be a Good Fit If YouHave 4+ years of software engineering experienceLike working on systems and tools that make other people more productiveAre results-oriented, with a bias towards flexibility and impactPick up slack, even if it goes outside your job descriptionEnjoy pair programming (we love to pair!)Want to learn more about machine learning researchCare about the societal impacts of your workStrong Candidates May Also Have Experience WithHigh performance, large scale distributed systemsLarge scale LLM trainingPythonImplementing LLM finetuning algorithms, such as RLHFRepresentative ProjectsProfiling our reinforcement learning pipeline to find opportunities for improvementBuilding a system that regularly launches training jobs in a test environment so that we can quickly detect problems in the training pipelineMaking changes to our finetuning systems so they work on new model architecturesBuilding instrumentation to detect and eliminate Python GIL contention in our training codeDiagnosing why training runs have started slowing down after some number of steps, and fixing itImplementing a stable, fast version of a new training algorithm proposed by a researcherDeadline to apply: None. Applications will be reviewed on a rolling basis.Annual SalaryThe expected salary range for this position is:$315,000 - $425,000 USDLogisticsEducation requirements: We require at least a Bachelor's degree in a related field or equivalent experience.Location-based hybrid policy: Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices.Visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.How We're DifferentWe believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.Come work with us!Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

When everyone in the organization can see and learn from the impact of their work on product, marketing, and company revenue metrics, they are poised to make better decisions.Over 9,000 paid customers, including companies like Netflix, Pinterest, Sweetgreen, and Samsara, use Mixpanel to understand their customers and measure progress. Our commitment is to provide the most comprehensive and reliable analytics platform accessible and trusted by all.We are actively recruiting for multiple Software Engineers across different levels for our org! About The RoleMixpanel engineering is a small team that works quickly, prioritizing getting value to customers and iterating to make those experiences even better. We offer the most powerful product analytics tool while still focusing on making the user experience delightful. The full stack engineers have the freedom to move about the stack to deliver value to customers without being blocked by ownership silos. This means doing everything from building snappy UIs and fast and reliable services to leveraging our powerful query engine to get the customers answers that help them deliver great products. We are looking for folks who seek to understand and own customer problems, participating in every step of the development life cycle from ideation to delivery and maintenance. We encourage ownership and autonomy—if you see customer pain points, you will be empowered to fix them. There is no \"not my problem\" at Mixpanel. All customer problems are ours to fix. We believe that our UX is a key differentiator, and we invest heavily in UI, aiming for a snappy and intuitive experience. We believe in Product-Led Growth, that even enterprise adoption of software tools starts with individual users and the way to get there is through creating a user experience that gets customers to answers quickly.ResponsibilitiesAt Mixpanel Engineering, Product, and Design (EPD) work closely in pods to define the product and experiences. You'll be collaborating closely with your EPD team to create a vision for delightful and intuitive UX, then work to deliver the most impactful features for our customers. You'll be owning key pieces of the product, maintaining them, and always advocating for improvements to make the user experience even better, adding to our growing shared components library and expanding our design system. You’ll be working on our web app, which is built in Python, running Django, with an open source JavaScript framework running the front end. Everything is run on Google Cloud Platform, using Kubernetes and Docker for orchestration and containerization of our services.A typical project requires working across our stack, creating endpoints for your feature as well as developing and deploying the UI. Here are some projects we've worked on in the past to give you an idea of what to expect.A way for customers to share their metrics publicly, a pain point for customers who want to easily share their data on social media or with executive leadership. This feature required keeping an eye on security so unintentional data would not be leaked for customers, but would enable easier collaboration.We rebuilt our Live View from the ground up and rebranded to Events. Our goal was to improve users’ trust and make debugging their data and query results easier. With these goals in mind, we removed a number of limitations from Live View, improved key work flows, and tightened the UX. We also drastically simplified both the back-end and front-end architecture resulting in a more performant and maintainable product. The end result is a more powerful tool for our users and a simpler codebase for our developers.We revamped our dashboards UI to improve the workflow for creating and saving analyses that also had the nice side effect of making our data model clearer. This required us to iterate and polish while learning more about how customers used and worked around our product in their day to day. We applied these learnings to smooth our workflows even more while continuing to set the stage for more series of improvements.We redesigned our query builder to allow users to instantly see the results of their changes on one screen. This was required balancing competing requirements of visual space for the query builder and the ability to see two things at once, resulting in a more intuitive UX.We made segmentation faster allowing users to customize what they can compare at the query time vs deciding everything they will ever need at the time they develop your product.What We're Looking ForWe are hiring full stack engineers at all levels across all teams.You take ownership of problems with a focus on delivering value to users/customers.You can deliver solutions that are pragmatic in approach.You have experience with web application architecture and principles.Additional ResourcesEngineering Life Page Engineering BlogCompensationThe amount listed below is the total target cash compensation (TTCC) and includes base compensation and variable compensation in the form of either a company bonus or commissions.

We have spent our careers founding and scaling companies like Plaid, Square, SoFi, Blend, and Affirm, and have seen this problem firsthand — builders and developers needing to partner with traditional banks, and creating API and abstraction layers over the patchwork that is the bank, its core, and many other vendors. All of this results in a complex (and often expensive) banking supply chain involving a user, fintech, BaaS middleware provider, bank, core and the Federal Reserve.At Column, we set out to simplify and fix this. We are a bank and a software company built from the ground up, offering builders and developers technology-forward banking solutions that cut out the hundreds of vendors, middleware providers, and abstraction layers.

Insurance claims, financial statements, invoices, and health records are all stored in a structure that’s simply impractical for use in digital workflows. This isn’t an inconvenience—it’s a critical bottleneck that leads to dozens of wasted hours every week.Traditional approaches fail at reliably extracting information in complex PDFsOCR and even more sophisticated ML approaches work for simple text documents but are unreliable for anything more complex. Text from different columns are jumbled together, figures are ignored, and tables are a nightmare to get right. Overcoming this usually requires a large engineering effort dedicated to building specialized pipelines for every document type you work with.Reducto Breaks Document Layouts Into Subsections And Then Contextually Parses Each Depending On The Type Of Content.
