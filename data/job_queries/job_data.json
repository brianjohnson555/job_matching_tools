By using massive amounts of new satellite data and pioneering work in artificial intelligence, Vortexa creates an unprecedented view on the global seaborne energy flows in real-time, bringing transparency and efficiency to the energy markets and society as a whole.The ChallengeIngesting data from multiple external vastly different sources at hundreds of rich data points per second, moving terabytes of data while processing it in real-time, running complex and complicated prediction and forecasting AI models while coupling their output into a hybrid human-machine data refinement process and presenting the result through a nimble low-latency SaaS solution used by customers around the globe is no small feat of science and engineering. This processing requires a highly reliable, stable, fault-tolerant infrastructure that can withstand multiple and varied uses and abuses by data analysts, data scientists, industry experts, and the end-users. Fast product iteration cycles necessitate a platform that allows engineers to deploy frequently, independently, and without in-depth knowledge of infrastructure complexities.The Data Services Team is responsible for the developer platform, and the impressive Amazon AWS estate Vortexa uses to achieve its purpose. This includes two major areas of concern: infrastructure availability, security and costs, as well as developer experience. We use a wide variety of technologies like Kubernetes, Kubevela, Golang, Kafka, Opensearch, Airflow, Athena, and others.You will be a key member of the small, globally distributed team, instrumental in assessing current technologies, delivering the best possible engineering experience with the shortest development iterations, helping crystallise, converge and standardise technology stacks and implementing the infrastructure roadmap, ensuring 100% uptime, availability, and fault-tolerance of every component of the platform, while optimising AWS costs. You will provide your customers such as data analysts, data scientists, and other engineers with a delightful developer experience tooling boosting their productivity, and allowing them to concentrate on business logic. You will codify and automate any operational knowledge gathered so that R&D can focus purely on creating value for our customers.

The program recognizes a common issue faced by many graduates: the skills taught in universities, while valuable, often do not translate directly into the hands-on expertise that employers are looking for. As a result, even well-educated individuals may find it challenging to secure jobs in the competitive tech market. SV Camp aims to resolve this discrepancy by offering a curriculum that emphasizes real-life scenarios and projects, closely mirroring the tasks and challenges professionals face in the tech industry. This hands-on approach ensures that students not only learn theoretical concepts but also apply them in practical settings, thereby gaining the experience and skills that are immediately applicable to their careers. The bootcamp is likely to include components such as coding projects, team collaborations, and perhaps internships or mentorships with tech companies, providing a comprehensive education that covers both the technical skills and the soft skills (like teamwork, communication, and problem-solving) that are crucial in the workplace. By focusing on these areas, SV Camp aims to produce graduates who are not just knowledgeable, but also ready to contribute effectively in their roles from day one, making them highly attractive to potential employers.

Island systems such as the Caribbean have been of particular interest because of their high species richness and endemism threatened by human activities. The study of the Caribbean biota was also fundamental in establishing the modern theoretical framework of island biography and how evolutionary processes like adaptative radiation unfold. However, the origin, evolution, and accumulation of this biota since the formation of the islands remain poorly understood.This project aims to use a holistic approach to understand how biodiversity hotspots originate on islands using phylogenetic comparative methods across multiple vertebrate clades from the Caribbean combined with new paleontological data from Paleogene and Neogene. We seek PhD-level candidates demonstrating experience in the Caribbean biota, ancestral range reconstructions, competency with at least one scripting language (e.g. Python, R), and interest in applying new statistical approaches.
