# Job matching tools
My job search toolkit. This repository is used for three purposes:

1. Deploying web scrapers to scrape online job postings.
2. Finding top matches between job postings and my resume, to aid my job search. Also, to help identify keywords to better tailor my resume to a given job description.
3. Exploratory learning on using various models/methods to perform the resume/job matching in item (2), using an existing dataset of over 100k job postings downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arshkon/linkedin-job-postings/data).

As this is a work in progress, I make no guarantees about the functionality of the code. Also note that web scraping of sites like LinkedIn can result in IP blocking; use the web scraping tools at your own risk.
